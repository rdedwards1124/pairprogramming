Challenge 3
Create a function called map that takes two inputs:
an array of numbers (a list of numbers)
a 'callback' function - a function that is applied to each element of the array (inside of the function 'map')
Have map return a new array filled with numbers that are the result of using the 'callback' function on each element of the input array.
map([1,2,3,4,5], multiplyByTwo); //-> [2,4,6,8,10]
multiplyByTwo(1); //-> 2
multiplyByTwo(2); //-> 4
  
Challenge 4
Create a function called forEach that takes an array and a callback, and runs the callback on each element of the array. forEach does not return anything.
let alphabet = '';
const letters = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd'];
forEach(letters, function(char) {
  alphabet += char;
});
console.log(alphabet);   //prints 'abcd'

Challenge 5
In challenge 3, you've created a function called map. In this challenge, you're going to rebuild the map function by creating a function called mapWith. This time you're going to use forEach inside of mapWith instead of using a for loop.
